The [MIG-21 FISHBED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-21) will be one of the featured aircraft. I still have to think about other aircraft to add in the future, but the first aircraft that I really wanted to design was the FISHBED.

You can notice the gaps near the belly, which is where the airbrakes are positioned once the spritesheet complete and ready for use within Phaser.
