The [MIG-21 FISHBED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-21) will be one of the featured aircraft. This is the first aircraft being designed. I still have to think about which other aircraft to add in the future, but the first aircraft that came into mind was the FISHBED.  The MIG-21 is the most widely produced military jet and has earned its place in aircraft history. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AlsW_Xx3dg) is A nice video demonstrating that this machine is a supersonic rocket equipped with wings (and pilot).

You can notice the gaps near the belly, which is where the airbrakes are positioned once the spritesheet is assembled in Phaser.
