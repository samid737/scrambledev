Welcome to the dev log of Scramble JS, A 2D combat flight simulator.

I started this project in the early months of 2017, but just recently decided to log all progress. There was A point at which I was completely stuck with modeling and basically the entire development was on hold for about 3-4 months. Then, by some miracle perhaps, that fundamental problem was solved and I can now continue  the development on A consistent level.

The project is currently not  open-source, I still have to decide if it will be in the future. If there are any questions you can always contact me.  I will try to update this log as much as I can, so stay tuned and enjoy the ride!
