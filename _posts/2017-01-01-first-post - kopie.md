Welcome to the dev log of Scramble JS. I started this project early 2017, but just recently decided to log all progress. The project is not yet open-source, but might be in the future. I will try to update this log as much as I can, so stay tuned! The site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), A very convenient blogging system.
 
*Scramble JS uses Phaser 2 as game engine. Fore more info, visit [Phaser.io](http://www.phaser.io).*
