# Intermezzo, personal stuff
Hello all,

I haven't posted any updates for quite a while.  Allow me to elaborate the situation last year.

I was in a critical position financially while I was attending university, completely isolated socially as I was sitting behind the [uni library's](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/using-the-library/opening-times-locations/library-learning-centre/) desktop for about 16 hours a day, coding  instead of attending courses. I was too anxious to apply for jobs initially, but doing interviews became manageable. The above did help me land a job around April last year.

I will summarize my current situation: I work at the same software company for about 1.5 years now , fortunately permanent, social part is improving,  I notice in social situations people like having a friendly person around and I often smile for no reason so that helps. I also decided to focus on my job instead of Uni. 

So fortunately things are going well now, I will dedicate time to this project as well , but let me just clone the repository first , its been a while :p !
