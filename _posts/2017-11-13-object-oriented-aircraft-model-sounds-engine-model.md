TODO

It's hard to describe how excited I am with the outcome of last week and I have added An awesome demonstration that will perfectly explain the new features (most of them).

## Object oriented model



## Finally sounds

Just to fool around A bit, I made some custom aircraft sound effects. Different engine sounds are added and their volumes are adjusted to match the engine thrust setting. No pitch adjustments unfortunately....not yet at least. Idle sounds, full power, afterburner thrust are added. A nice [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9epcjTej7E) is also added to the video below just to spice things up (NOT ADDED TO THE GAME). A stall warning beep sound is also added.

## Engine model revisited
